        Two players compete on a board, on which 24 slots are drawn. Some slots are connected
        and are said to be <strong>adjacent</strong> slots.<br> The connected slots from
        three squares of 8 slots.<br>
        A straight line of 3 adjacent slots is a <strong>mill</strong>.<br>
        There are 16 mills: the 12 edges of the squares, and 4 horizontal or vertical lines
        connecting the centers of the edges.<br>        
        The players play alternatively. BLACK plays first, then WHITE.
        Each player has a stock of 9 pieces.
        <br>
        The game has three phases.<br>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>Placement</strong>
        As long as you have pieces to put on the board (MY_STOCK is not zero),
        you must PUT a piece from your stock onto an empty slot on the board.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Movement</strong>
        When you have no more pieces to put on the board (MY_STOCK is zero),
        you must MOVE one of your pieces to an adjacent, empty slot.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Jumping</strong>
        When you have only three pieces left (MY_STOCK is zero and MY_PIECES is three),
        you must MOVE one of your pieces to any empty slot, regardless of adjacency.
        In other words, you may jump.
        </li>
        </ul>
        In any phase, when your move (or put) results in a mill newly filled with your pieces,
        you must remove from the board a piece of your opponent, that is not itself part of a filled mill.<br>
        A mill is <strong>not new</strong> when you have already filled it with the same pieces (),
        in any order.
        <br>
        During the placement phase, it is possible to fill two mills in one turn. In such a case,
        you must remove two pieces of your opponent.
        <br>
        The game is over when any of the following conditions occurs:
        <ul>
          <li>Each player has played 200 turns.</li>
          <li>Some player looses.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        You <strong>lose</strong> if:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You have only two pieces left (MY_PIECES is two, and MY_STOCK is zero).
          </li>
          <li>
            Your program times out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your program provides invalid output for the active phase.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the game is over, you have less pieces on the board than your opponent.
          </li>
        </ul>
        A tie is possible, should the game end when both players have the same number of pieces on the board.
